Rothamsted Research is a world-leading, non-profit research centre that focuses on strategic agricultural science to the benefit of farmers and society worldwide. Our purpose is to empower society with the best scientific knowledge to produce sufficient nutritious food whilst caring for the environment, and our mission is to undertake cutting-edge agricultural science and innovation, in collaboration with others, to generate discoveries and knowledge with wide impact and outreach.  

One of our Strategic Areas is a unique grouping of analytical and computational science teams delivering, managing and analysing high precision, high content and high throughput data from agricultural science experiments. The research we undertake is often interdisciplinary and creates (or validates) new analytical approaches, new analysis methods, new software and new resources for direct application to Rothamstedâ€™s science portfolios and more widely to research in agricultural systems. We also make numerous data, software tools and other information widely available to the global scientific community and other stakeholders or beneficiaries of our work.

Rothamsted Research is primarily funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Council (BBSRC), and also receives funding from other government bodies, levy Boards charities and industry.
